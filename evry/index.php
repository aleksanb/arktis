<p>
Not too long ago,<br />
Thousands of people joined forces,<br />
Sharing the same vision,<br />
They hammered out a clear mission.<br />
Tonight,<br />
Representing EVRY,<br />
Only one challenge remains,<br />
And that is:<br />
To get the party started!<br />
<br />
So come on everybody,<br />
Be strong and,<br />
Embrace the infinite opportunities!<br />
<br />
We got the power.<br />
We got the power.<br />
We got the power.<br />
<br />
Mike check one two one two,<br />
Check this out.<br />
<br />
Who can you call to get the job done, <em>(who)</em><br />
EVRY is still number one. <em>(yeah)</em><br />
We embrace opportunity,<br />
Bring information to life,<br />
You and me, tell me:<br />
Who's the king?<br />
Process is king!<br />

As a team we perform together, <em>(yeah!)</em><br />
Empowered inspired beyond any expectations.<br />

Process is king!<br />
Who's the king?<br />
Product is king!<br />

<br />
They say we're number one,<br />
On the throne,<br />
I've heard that's what they say.<br />
They say it's EVRY in the house,<br />
People know that we don't play.<br />
We anticipate needs,<br />
All on point,<br />
They know we never miss.<br />
Evry has a song,<br />
In the stash,<br />
And it goes a little something like this: <em>(this)</em><br />
<br />
